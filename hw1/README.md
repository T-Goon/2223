# hw1 Double Trouble

Patrick Houlihan, Tim Goon, Adrian Curless

A game written in C++ called "Double Trouble". The game starts with 3 green markers, 7 yellow markers, and 5 orange markers. 2 players take turns removing as many markers of a 
single color as they wish. The player that removes the last marker wins. The opponent in this game is always an AI that plays a random valid move unless it is able to 
make a winning move.

To play the game, compile the program (Preferable on linux using the provided Makefile).
Then launch the hw1 executable. Select f or s to move first or second. Then type 'g' for
green, 'y' for yellow or 'o' for orange, followed by the number of pieces of that color
you wish to take. Continue to move until you either win or lose. Good Luck!
