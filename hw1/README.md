To play the game, compile the program (Preferable on linux using the provided Makefile).
Then launch the hw1 executable. Select f or s to move first or second. Then type 'g' for
green, 'y' for yellow or 'o' for orange, followed by the number of pieces of that color
you wish to take. Continue to move until you either win or lose. Good Luck!
