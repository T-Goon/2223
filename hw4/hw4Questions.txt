Question 1:
The ForwardElimination algorithm doesn't work properly for that system of equations because after

the first pass of the algorithm the next value of the diagonal going from upper left to lower right,

position (1,1) to (2,2), becomes 0.

When that happens the algorithm cannot continue because in the next iteration it must divide by that 
number and any number divided by 0 is undefined.


[1, 1, 1, 6]      [1, 1, 1, 6]    Cannot continue because the algorithm does 1/0 ((3, 2)/(2, 2))

[1, 1, 2, 9]  ->  [0, 0, 1, 3] -> which is undefined.

[1, 2, 3, 14]     [0, 1, 2, 8]



The BetterForwardElimination algorithm fixes this by swapping the rows so that the row with the

largest value that it needs to divide by is the pivot row.


[1, 1, 1, 6]      [1, 1, 1, 6]    Second and [1, 1, 1, 6]    [1, 1, 1, 6] 

[1, 1, 2, 9]  ->  [0, 0, 1, 3] -> third row  [0, 1, 2, 8] -> [0, 1, 2, 8] -> Algorithm Complete

[1, 2, 3, 14]     [0, 1, 2, 8]    swap       [0, 0, 1, 3]    [0, 0, 1, 3]

Question 2:

The given system of linear equations,

x   +   y   +   z   =   6
x   +   y   +   2z  =   9
2x  +   2y  +   3z  =   15

The algorithm can not solve this system because x and y both become 0 in the process of

Gauss - Jordan Elimination. Since in all equations, x and y have the same coefficients,

this should raise suspicion when solving. For the given solution, 1 = x, 2 = y, 3 = z,

the math works, and this is a solution. However when actually attempting to solve the system,

we can see that, for z = 3, which we know works, you can reduce the system into this.

x   +   y   +   3   =   6
x   +   y   +   6   =   9
2x  +   2y  +   9   =   15

When simplied, this system occurs

x   +   y   =   3
x   +   y   =   3
x   +   y   =   3

These are all the same equation, meaning that for the value of z = 3, there are infinitely many solutions,

some of which are,

x = 4, y = -1
x = 5, y = -2.

This is no fault of the algorithm, and by not finding a solution, it is atually doing its job since there are

an infinite number to find. Nothing needs to be done to fix the algorithm other than providing it proper

input.
